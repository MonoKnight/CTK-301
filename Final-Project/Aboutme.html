			<h2> About Me </h2>

			<p class="paragraph"> I am currently game design major at Illinois State University! I am pursuing my passion for video games by learning how to make my own. I am working towords my masters so that I can eventually start my own game creation company. I also am studying web design, audio design, and art design in addition to game design. </p>

			<h2> History </h2>

			<p class="paragraph"> Currently, I have settled on game design as my dream job, but there was a lot that I wanted to do before game design. I didn't know what I wanted to do before highschool, but I pursued a lot of different interests when during my years. The fields that interested me the most were chemical engineering, software engineering, and hardware engineering, but none of them sticked with me. I didn't know it at the time, but it was because none of them let me pursue the creative side of my brain. Once I learned about game design, I finally understand what I wanted to do with my life, and now here I am pursuing game design. </p>

			<h2> Comission Info </h2>

			<p class="paragraph"> I love making art, so if you ever see something you like that I have made and want something similar, message me. As long as I have nothing keeping me busy at the moment, I am always willing to take comissions. The fastest way to message me is by email, but I also regularly check twitter if you prefer that way.</p>
