    <p> As it says in the image, this is a poster for the Brookfield Zoo. I don't know if it was ever used for anything outside of practice, but I still like it. The red text really pops up on the background with the black panther. If I was a kid and saw this poster, I would be begging my parents to go to the zoo for the rest of the day. </p>
